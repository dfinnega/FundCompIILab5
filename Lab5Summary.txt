In lab 5, we will be creating a template class Sudoku which will be used to
play a game of Sudoku. For part2 we will only have to create the class and
have it be able to read in either ints or chars from a file and then then
display then display the game board. For part 3 we need to add an
interactive session for the user where they can play a sudoku game. The game
must check for valid moves, and see if the user has won the game.
